          Brilliant you must be
          <br />
          To tie the hands of a king
          <br />
          To pit him against his own God until your image seemed more esteemed
          <br />
          Until you were more thunderous, more merciful, more just
          <br />
          Until it was you who brought dawn and you who brought dusk
          <br />
          <br />
          I have met you before
          <br />
          When I wandered off the treacherous path
          <br />
          A captivating picture
          <br />
          Sun rays beaming from the rose water of your bath
          <br />
          Fruitful temptation is easy to swear off while on your knees
          <br />
          But it’s scary how quickly one’s wants can turn to needs
          <br />
          <br />
          I turn to walk away, back to the thorny road
          <br />
          Where promises seem much farther away than the ones I’m told
          <br />
          Live on that roof, swim beneath the waters of compulsion
          <br />
          The currents that pull on human impulsion
          <br />
          <br />
          Sometimes I don’t look back at the path from which I strayed
          <br />
          Sometimes I climb to the roof without sparing a glance the other way
          <br />
          Sometimes I find familiar faces who have wandered as well
          <br />
          Sometimes I find I have only myself
          <br />
          <br />
          Guilt pushes me from the roof and sends me tumbling to the ground
          <br />
          Familiar knots in my chest as regret surrounds
          <br />
          Me who has lost the path on which I traveled
          <br />
          For the road to promises doesn’t except those who lose battles
          <br />
          <br />
          She is full of lies, a deceiver of kings
          <br />
          A demon behind dove colored wings
          <br />
          I cast her away, promise to follow the path til it ends
          <br />
          Yet somehow I know Bathsheba and I will meet again
