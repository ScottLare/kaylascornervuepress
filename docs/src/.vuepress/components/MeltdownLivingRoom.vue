Meltdown In The Living Room

I need somebody’s help.

Please I need somebody’s help

My guts are splattered on the floor

And my mom’s gonna scream  

Cause I stained our living room carpet

And I can’t get it clean 



Please I need somebody’s help

There’s vermillion in the white shag

And I’m rubbing

And rubbing

And rubbing

But it’s just blending into this blush colored sea

And although my liver’s on the coffee table

This pink rug will be the death of me



Can someone tell me where the dump is?

The nearest thrift shop too?

I think my mom bought this at Goodwill

I would have been with her

But I was with you



I was with you all the time

Wasted days and nights

When you mended my bones

Bruises and scars

Just to cut me open 

Twist the knife in deep

And now I need somebody’s help

Because you never needed me



And my insides are pouring out

Onto the couch 

The same place where I’d rest my head on your chest

And listen to your heartbeat

Now I’m watching my own

Thump against the beige cushions

I wonder what my mom will say

When she sees the mess I’ve made of her home



I need a doctor 

A doctor’s expert hand

To stitch me back up

Before I pour out again

It seems I’m no genius with a needle

Because everytime I think I’m fine

I see my pancreas on the floorboards

And I’m empty inside



I didn’t want somebody’s help

Because no one had to know

That sometimes my ribs

Would crumple or grow

Until they were pushing at my chest

And I couldn’t breathe

But no one could see

So they thought I was fine

And I let them believe



But now the evidence is everywhere

Like ink blots on a page

White has turned to pink 

And I can’t cover up my pain

As I watch my tendons tie at my ankles

And push me to the ground

I wonder how I ever felt

Like I didn’t need somebody

Somebody’s help
