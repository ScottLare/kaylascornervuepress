          Meltdown In The Living Room

          <br />
          I need somebody’s help.
          <br />
          Please I need somebody’s help
          <br />
          My guts are splattered on the floor
          <br />
          And my mom’s gonna scream
          <br />
          Cause I stained our living room carpet
          <br />
          And I can’t get it clean
          <br />
          <br />
          Please I need somebody’s help
          <br />
          There’s vermillion in the white shag
          <br />
          And I’m rubbing
          <br />
          And rubbing
          <br />
          And rubbing
          <br />
          But it’s just blending into this blush colored sea
          <br />
          And although my liver’s on the coffee table
          <br />
          This pink rug will be the death of me
          <br />
          <br />
          Can someone tell me where the dump is?
          <br />
          The nearest thrift shop too?
          <br />
          I think my mom bought this at Goodwill
          <br />
          I would have been with her
          <br />
          But I was with you
          <br />
          <br />
          I was with you all the time
          <br />
          Wasted days and nights
          <br />
          When you mended my bones
          <br />
          Bruises and scars
          <br />
          Just to cut me open
          <br />
          Twist the knife in deep
          <br />
          And now I need somebody’s help
          <br />
          Because you never needed me
          <br />
          <br />
          And my insides are pouring out
          <br />
          Onto the couch
          <br />
          The same place where I’d rest my head on your chest
          <br />
          And listen to your heartbeat
          <br />
          Now I’m watching my own
          <br />
          Thump against the beige cushions
          <br />
          I wonder what my mom will say
          <br />
          When she sees the mess I’ve made of her home
          <br />
          <br />
          I need a doctor
          <br />
          A doctor’s expert hand
          <br />
          To stitch me back up
          <br />
          Before I pour out again
          <br />
          It seems I’m no genius with a needle
          <br />
          Because everytime I think I’m fine
          <br />
          I see my pancreas on the floorboards
          <br />
          And I’m empty inside
          <br />
          <br />
          I didn’t want somebody’s help
          <br />
          Because no one had to know
          <br />
          That sometimes my ribs
          <br />
          Would crumple or grow
          <br />
          Until they were pushing at my chest
          <br />
          And I couldn’t breathe
          <br />
          But no one could see
          <br />
          So they thought I was fine
          <br />
          And I let them believe
          <br />
          <br />
          But now the evidence is everywhere
          <br />
          Like ink blots on a page
          <br />
          White has turned to pink
          <br />
          And I can’t cover up my pain
          <br />
          As I watch my tendons tie at my ankles
          <br />
          And push me to the ground
          <br />
          I wonder how I ever felt
          <br />
          Like I didn’t need somebody
          <br />
          Somebody’s help
          <br />
