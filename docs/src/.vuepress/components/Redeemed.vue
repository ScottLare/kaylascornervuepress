          You’re in charge of your own destiny. That’s the quote isn’t it? The
          one humans came up with to try and convince themselves they had power.
          Power over their choices, power over their fate. It was laughable
          really. Phoenix never met any other creature so desperate for power
          and control. He wondered how they would react if they were told the
          truth. That God created them as puppets and Lucifer fought Him for the
          strings. He supposed they would react however the puppet masters
          wanted them too. The thought amused him.
          <br />
          <br />
          Powerless people always amused him.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="italic">Lie.</span> His whisper echoed through Jasper’s
          brain. Jasper. What a stupid name. What a stupid human.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anna rolled her eyes. For someone who doesn’t believe in passive
          aggressiveness she certainly did that a lot.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="italic">Don’t lie.</span> She urged.
          <span class="italic">Tell your father the truth.</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="italic">The truth?</span> Phoenix argued.<span
            class="italic"
          >
            He’ll hate you if he knows the truth.</span
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          Anna looked at the demon, exasperated. “Really Phoenix? He broke a
          vase.”
          <br />
          <br />
          I ignored the angel. I’ve become quite good at doing that.<span
            class="italic"
          >
            Blame it on your sister and run away to your grandmother’s house.
            She’s two blocks down the street, you’d make it.</span
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasper looked up at his father. “I think Sophia and her friend were
          messing around…”
          <br />
          <br />
          Anna sighed as Phoenix grinned. It was little wins like this that made
          this detestable job worth doing.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Okay you got your lie,” Anna said, her voice shaking slightly like it
          always does when something immoral happens. “Can you leave now?"
          <br />
          <br />
          “I will actually,” Phoenix replied. “Laziness and a job half done are
          two qualities that I pride myself on. I’ll miss you in Hell.”
          <br />
          <br />
          He stuck his tongue out at the angel, who flinched at the mention of
          his home. In a flash, he disappeared, reappearing on a beach. He sat
          down on the bones that littered the shore. They were all animal bones,
          from bear to dog to human. He watched the dark red waves crash down by
          the shore. The ocean of blood blended into the sky of fire where they
          kissed at the horizon line. It was horrifying. It was beautiful.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Aren’t you supposed to be on a job right now?” A deep voice came from
          Phoenix's left. “I believe Jasper’s still awake.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Phoenix groaned as the demon came into his line of vision. “Hello,
          Cupid. Pleasure seeing you here.”
          <br />
          <br />
          “Shut up,” Cupid responded. “Even an angel could lie better than
          that.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Cupid was the only demon who resembled a divine being. Even after
          millions of years it still took Phoenix by surprise. Soft features,
          bright eyes, curls that gently surrounded his face. He could easily be
          mistaken for Eros, the angel of love.
          <br />
          <br />
          It’s exactly what humans do, time and time again. They mistake
          heartbreak for true love.
          <br />
          <br />
          Did Phoenix mention how pitiful humans are?
          <br />
          <br />
          “Anna’s got it covered for now.” Phoenix said scornfully, shifting his
          weight and hearing the <span class="italic">crack </span> of bones
          from underneath him. Oh Lucifer, how he loves that sound.
          <br />
          <br />
          He missed when demons had free reign over the world. Murdering
          innocents, starting wars, spreading the wingspan of death. Then humans
          started getting self-aware and made their jobs so much harder. They
          were demoted to human consciousness! Destined to be stuck on the
          shoulder of some unimportant, irrelevant, meatbag with legs for the
          span of their short, uneventful lifetime. It truly was a curse, but it
          could have been manageable. It could have if it weren’t for the
          angels.
          <br />
          <br />
          For every demon on the shoulder of a human, an angel is on the other
          side. Once that human dies the two immortal entities get assigned
          another one. It was an endless cycle, and Phoenix was stuck in it with
          Anna. It truly was eternal damnation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Everytime a meatbag died, Phoenix would hope for an evil soul. Maybe
          another Hitler, or Dahmer, damn he’d even settle for a Kardashian. But
          everytime, his new human has a soul that was just so… average.
          <br />
          <br />
          Don’t even get him started on Jasper. Phoenix’s newest sack of bones
          was about as interesting as white bread.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I don’t particularly enjoy being ignored, Phoenix.” Cupid said.
          <br />
          <br />
          “That’s too bad ‘cause I find it rather nice ignoring you.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Cupid huffed. “I asked you why you’re leaving an angel in charge of
          your host. The boss wouldn’t be too happy about that.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Phoenix stood up, towering over Cupid. Cupid was nothing but
          irritating and Phoenix would have made a soup out of his organs if he
          wasn’t the boss’ favorite. Cupid knew that of course. He miks it for
          all its worth.
          <br />
          <br />
          “What I do in my free time isn’t any of your business.” Phoenix said,
          flashing his fangs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cupid didn’t seem phased, much to Phoenix’s annoyance. “This isn’t
          your free time Phoenix, in fact, it seems your harp playing, ruby
          lipped angel already undid your work of the day.” Cupid waved his
          hand, an image appearing in the air. It was like a movie, starring
          Jasper, who seemed to be apologizing to his father. His father (or
          wrinkly Jasper as Phoenix liked to call him) pulled him into a tight
          hug, telling him that he never liked that vase anyways.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cupid waved his hand again and the images disappeared. “Pity.” Cupid
          gave the other demon a mocking gaze. “I’ve been telling Lucifer-” The
          sky grumbled in response to the boss’ name. “That demons have been
          slacking off. You’ll be a fantastic example. I bet if you’re lucky
          he’ll feed you to the Serpent.”
          <br />
          <br />
          “You’re such a little suck-up.” Phoenix felt anger boiling within him.
          Cupid was known for butting his head into other demon’s business, but
          for hell’s sake, Phoenix was sick of it. He shoved Cupid with as much
          force as he could muster. Cupid flew backward, his body landing hard
          on the ground. Phoenix knew the loud crunch was the bones on the
          beach, but it brought a smile to his face thinking it was Cupid.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cupid rose to his feet. Phoenix braced himself, but Cupid didn’t
          retaliate.
          <br />
          <br />
          “You’re going to regret that.” Cupid fumed, disappearing into a cloud
          of hot pink smoke.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Coward!” Phoenix spat at the cloud. He knew Cupid would probably go
          to Lucifer and beg to have Phoenix’s head hung in his bedroom. He
          didn’t really care. At least death would get him away from his stupid
          job.
          <br />
          <br />
          Cupid had been right about one thing. Phoenix had to go back.
          Groaning, Phoenix snapped himself back to the abhorrent garbage dump
          called Earth.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Oh…” Anna turned her attention away from the bathroom mirror where
          she had been admiring her wings; while Jasper brushed his teeth with a
          Ninja Turtles toothbrush. “You’re back.”
        </p>

        <p
          class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-center ml-0 mr-0 sm:ml-10 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl"
        >
          “Obviously.”
          <br />
          <br />
          “Well Jasper’s going to bed soon, so there really wasn’t any point.”
          <br />
          <br />
          “Can you please not…” Phoenix held up a hand as he sat defeatedly down
          on Jasper’s shoulder. “I had a rough day.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Anna laughed. It was a twinkling sound, like wind chimes. “Isn’t every
          day rough for you?"
          <br />
          <br />
          “Well, yes.” Phoenix looked around Jasper’s head so he could see
          Anna’s face. She was looking at him. Attentive, even to a demon. Cupid
          had been right about her having ruby lips. Phoenix wondered
          absentmindedly if she really did play the harp. “That’s the price you
          pay when you choose damnation over glory.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Anna sighed. “You didn’t choose your destiny. It was fate. I’m sorry
          that fate chose poorly for you.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Phoenix would normally get mad when Anna said pretentious things like
          that. She constantly reminded him that being an angel was better than
          being a demon. It was strange tonight though. He didn’t feel like
          arguing or making a hurtful comment. He felt almost touched that Anna
          would feel bad for him. That she cared. Which was woah… weird.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="italic">Take three.</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasper popped three Flintstone vitamins into his mouth, before
          switching off the light.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anna gasped. “Phoenix, you know the daily dosage is two!”
          <br />
          <br />
          “I know.” Phoenix laughed at Anna’s befuddlement. “That’s why I did
          it.”
          <br />
          <br />
          To Phoenix’s surprise, Anna started laughing too. Had he done that?
          How can he do it again? Why did he want to do it again?
          <br />
          <br />
          “Jasper’s asleep.” Anna said after awhile, pulling Phoenix out of his
          concerning thoughts. “We’re off the clock.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Phoenix felt a strange disappointment settle in his chest. Why? He was
          always glad when his shift ended. In fact, he couldn’t remember a time
          when he bothered staying around until the end of it.
          <br />
          <br />
          He looked at Anna, who seemed to be just as confused as Phoenix. She
          was probably wondering why he hadn’t left in a trail of flames yet.
          Phoenix was wondering that too.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I better get back then,” Anna smiled at Phoenix, sending a chill down
          his spine. He never noticed the gold rings around her blue eyes. It’s
          been centuries, yet he never noticed. They were beautiful.
          <br />
          <br />
          Wait.
          <br />
          <br />
          No.
          <br />
          <br />
          Anna had disappeared into a gold dust, but Phoenix remained. Frozen.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="italic">Cupid.</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          His voice was on a loop in Phoenix’s head. That mocking tone.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="italic"> You’re going to regret that.</span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Phoenix was in love. <span class="italic">In love.</span> He had no
          heart but he was in love. He was ready to raise hell if it meant being
          with Anna. He would climb to the clouds for her.
          <br />
          <br />
          He would drag heaven to the ground.
          <br />
          <br />
          And yes, that was exactly what he planned to do.
