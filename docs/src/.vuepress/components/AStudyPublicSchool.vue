          Trapped inside a red-brick cage
          <br />
          Nothing you can do
          <br />
          But let time slip away
          <br />
          Pencils tapping and pens clicking
          <br />
          Brain fried from lack of sleeping
          <br />
          <br />
          Busy work, that’s what we’re given
          <br />
          Meaningless sheets meant for children
          <br />
          Nothing that inspires growth or creativity
          <br />
          Teachers ignore America’s promise of liberty
          <br />
          <br />
          To learn something that will help me in the future?
          <br />
          The importance of algebra is just a rumor
          <br />
          Sharing tired glances with zombified peers
          <br />
          Counting down days ‘til we’re out of here
          <br />
          <br />
          The stress so heavy it curves my shoulders in
          <br />
          The days so indistinguishable
          <br />
          My patience paper thin
          <br />
          Day after day like an endless abyss
          <br />
          These are the days they tell us we’ll miss
