A Study Of The Public School System

Trapped inside a red-brick cage

Nothing you can do

But let time slip away

Pencils tapping and pens clicking

Brain fried from lack of sleeping



Busy work, that’s what we’re given

Meaningless sheets meant for children

Nothing that inspires growth or creativity

Teachers ignore America’s promise of liberty



To learn something that will help me in the future?

The importance of algebra is just a rumor

Sharing tired glances with zombified peers

Counting down days ‘til we’re out of here



The stress so heavy it curves my shoulders in

The days so indistinguishable 

My patience paper thin

Day after day like an endless abyss

These are the days they tell us we’ll miss        </p>
