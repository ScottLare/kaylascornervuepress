          Be wary of beauty, of unrestrained charm
          <br />
          Keep your distance, race away
          <br />
          From the welcoming arms
          <br />
          Of seduction and mystery
          <br />
          Of that unattainable desire
          <br />
          That such pleasure could be yours
          <br />
          That you could embrace burning fire
          <br />
          <br />
          Don’t hide because of temptation
          <br />
          Nor flee because of envy
          <br />
          It is not the sin you have to fear
          <br />
          But the person that follows every
          <br />
          Iridescent being, who is not dangerous until
          <br />
          They are loved by someone with nothing
          <br />
          Nothing but a quill
          <br />
          <br />
          It’s wonderful at first
          <br />
          Crafted by fate’s own hands
          <br />
          Someone with enchantment to capture
          <br />
          Someone who fully understands
          <br />
          How to transfer elegance to paper
          <br />
          To turn ethereality to ink
          <br />
          But just because you can copy heaven
          <br />
          Does not mean you can teach it how to think
          <br />
          <br />
          Elusive it is, the beauty of the divine
          <br />
          Tie it to a canvas but somehow you’ll find
          <br />
          That there’s always more to capture
          <br />
          Always more to bound
          <br />
          But beauty is found in freedom
          <br />
          And freedom is impossible to hold down
          <br />
          <br />
          So beauty escapes
          <br />
          Like a dove from its cage
          <br />
          And finds itself once again the object
          <br />
          Of every admiring gaze
          <br />
          Except for one who has nothing
          <br />
          Nothing but remnants of art
          <br />
          Nothing but a quill
          <br />
          Nothing but a splintered heart
          <br />
          <br />
          This is what you must fear
          <br />
          Those with expression
          <br />
          Dorian Gray saved his youth
          <br />
          But he had to destroy the murder weapon
          <br />
          The only thing that can destroy beauty
          <br />
          Bring grace’s reign to an end
          <br />
          Is the bitterness of an artist
          <br />
          And when that artist seeks revenge
          <br />
          <br />
          The roses turn to thorns in their paint covered hands
          <br />
          The smiling faces drenched, in dark, dreary lands
          <br />
          The artist the only one who truly knew what beauty could do
          <br />
          The artist the only one who could change the lovely muse
          <br />
          <br />
          So be wary of beauty
          <br />
          And what it will bring
          <br />
          Heartbreak and loss
          <br />
          A noose of golden string
          <br />
          But be more cautious of what follows
          <br />
          Where beauty is stored
          <br />
          Because often the pen
          <br />
          Is also the sword
