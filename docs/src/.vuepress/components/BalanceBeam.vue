I’m from the sound of racing feet 

Upon a dried up summer lawn 

I’m from the shivers under my coat 

As I stomp across the New York snow 

I’m from a stitch between two worlds 

Vegetable gardens and Madison Square 

I’m from two different American Dreams 

Two paths that merged into one 

 

I am from blended paints 

From burnt toast breakfasts and curry spice dinners 

I am from scrambled letters 

From midnight drives and early morning runs 

I’m from a safety net, from "don't talk to strangers” 

I’m from “there are no rules, but elbows off the table” 

 

I am from a balance beam 

From a variety of dimensions 

Where the directions are all different 

Where things jumble and combine 

I’m from a collage  

Pasted and taped together 

A collage that reminds me of all my contradictions 

All my contradictions, they are where I am from 

But it’s my contradictions that make me wonder 

What will I become?
