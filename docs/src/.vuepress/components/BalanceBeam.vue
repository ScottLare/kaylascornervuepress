          I’m from the sound of racing feet
          <br />
          Upon a dried up summer lawn
          <br />
          I’m from the shivers under my coat
          <br />
          As I stomp across the New York snow
          <br />
          I’m from a stitch between two worlds
          <br />
          Vegetable gardens and Madison Square
          <br />
          I’m from two different American Dreams
          <br />
          Two paths that merged into one
          <br />
          <br />
          I am from blended paints
          <br />
          From burnt toast breakfasts and curry spice dinners
          <br />
          I am from scrambled letters
          <br />
          From midnight drives and early morning runs
          <br />
          I’m from a safety net, from "don't talk to strangers”
          <br />
          I’m from “there are no rules, but elbows off the table”
          <br />
          <br />
          I am from a balance beam
          <br />
          From a variety of dimensions
          <br />
          Where the directions are all different
          <br />
          Where things jumble and combine
          <br />
          I’m from a collage
          <br />
          Pasted and taped together
          <br />
          A collage that reminds me of all my contradictions
          <br />
          All my contradictions, they are where I am from
          <br />
          But it’s my contradictions that make me wonder
          <br />
          What will I become?
