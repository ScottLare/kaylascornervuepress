          He’s brilliant and cool, and frighteningly tall
          <br />
          He has everything you want, anything at all
          <br />
          He speaks a bit of French, his lips curl when he smiles
          <br />
          He has a glimmer in his eye, a James Dean sort of style
          <br />
          <br />

          This is not a sappy testament to my love for him
          <br />

          Nor a silly diary entry depicting how I’ll win
          <br />

          His heart which is surely an infinitesimal size
          <br />

          No this is more a list
          <br />

          A list of all the reasons he should die
          <br />
          <br />

          One he wakes up with a new girl every day
          <br />

          Two he breaks hearts when he refuses to stay
          <br />

          Three he’s nothing but a living walking cliche
          <br />

          Four I’m pretty sure he killed someone last May
          <br />
          <br />

          Now I can’t be certain, so please don’t repeat
          <br />

          But I haven’t seen Daisy and it’s been twenty weeks
          <br />

          She went on a date with him, beguiled by his charm
          <br />

          No way with those heels could she escape from any harm
          <br />
          <br />

          He seems so innocent, but that never fooled me

          <br />

          One time I saw him, after period three

          <br />

          Behind the bleachers, sitting in the shade

          <br />

          I could’ve sworn he was holding a very bloody blade
          <br />
          <br />

          I don’t know what I should do
          <br />

          If my thoughts are even true
          <br />

          But I don’t trust him as he flirts with every girl in school
          <br />

          Wouldn’t it be on me if another went missing?
          <br />

          What if his next victim is the blonde girl he’s been kissing?
          <br />
          <br />

          I have to stop it, maybe alert the police
          <br />

          But as it turns out, his father’s the chief
          <br />

          I need to get him alone, which sounds frankly crazy
          <br />
          But someone has to avenge poor, guiltless Daisy
          <br />
          <br />

          This part is probably not best to say aloud
          <br />

          And once I get my thoughts out, I’ll burn this paper down
          <br />

          The plan is to smile and wear ruby red lips
          <br />

          The plan is to beg him for one little kiss
          <br />
          <br />

          I don’t know how dangerous he is, what he’s capable of
          <br />

          I don’t know what he’ll do when push comes to shove
          <br />

          But he also doesn’t know a thing about me
          <br />

          And just how dangerous I can really be
          <br />
          <br />
          I am angry and ruthless, and so very determined
          <br />

          I am merciless and cruel, with no patience for vermin
          <br />

          So he speaks French? So he has a glimmer in his eye?
          <br />

          He is about to kiss everything goodbye
        </p>
