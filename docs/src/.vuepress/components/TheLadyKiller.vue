          He’s brilliant and cool, and frighteningly tall He has everything you
          want, anything at all He speaks a bit of French, his lips curl when he
          smiles He has a glimmer in his eye, a James Dean sort of style
          <br />
          <br />

          This is not a sappy testament to my love for him Nor a silly diary
          entry depicting how I’ll win His heart which is surely an
          infinitesimal size No this is more a list A list of all the reasons he
          should die
          <br />
          <br />

          One he wakes up with a new girl every day Two he breaks hearts when he
          refuses to stay Three he’s nothing but a living walking cliche Four
          I’m pretty sure he killed someone last May
          <br />
          <br />

          Now I can’t be certain, so please don’t repeat But I haven’t seen
          Daisy and it’s been twenty weeks She went on a date with him, beguiled
          by his charm No way with those heels could she escape from any harm
          <br />
          <br />

          He seems so innocent, but that never fooled me One time I saw him,
          after period three Behind the bleachers, sitting in the shade I
          could’ve sworn he was holding a very bloody blade
          <br />
          <br />

          I don’t know what I should do If my thoughts are even true But I don’t
          trust him as he flirts with every girl in school Wouldn’t it be on me
          if another went missing? What if his next victim is the blonde girl
          he’s been kissing?
          <br />
          <br />

          I have to stop it, maybe alert the police But as it turns out, his
          father’s the chief I need to get him alone, which sounds frankly crazy
          But someone has to avenge poor, guiltless Daisy
          <br />
          <br />

          This part is probably not best to say aloud And once I get my thoughts
          out, I’ll burn this paper down The plan is to smile and wear ruby red
          lips The plan is to beg him for one little kiss
          <br />
          <br />

          I don’t know how dangerous he is, what he’s capable of I don’t know
          what he’ll do when push comes to shove But he also doesn’t know a
          thing about me And just how dangerous I can really be
          <br />
          <br />
          I am angry and ruthless, and so very determined I am merciless and
          cruel, with no patience for vermin So he speaks French? So he has a
          glimmer in his eye? He is about to kiss everything goodbye
