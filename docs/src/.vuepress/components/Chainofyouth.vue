          Zeus was a liar
          <br />
          But they still put a crown of jewels atop his head
          <br />
          When humans catch fire
          <br />
          It’s sometimes easier to burn than pretend
          <br />
          Like everything’s alright, That the gods are in control
          <br />
          Because Pandora’s box was reopened
          <br />
          And there’s no longer hope left to hold
          <br />
          <br />
          I’ve become the master of my own fate
          <br />
          Sitting on a throne of my own construction
          <br />
          Because I realized a little too late
          <br />
          Trust leads to destruction
          <br />
          So I’ll do it on my own
          <br />
          After all, we fought for independence
          <br />
          I’ll take every one of Zeus’ stones
          <br />
          And wear them like a necklace
          <br />
          <br />
          There are many things I can’t do
          <br />
          Like work a nine to five
          <br />
          I can’t pay bills, rent a car
          <br />
          Buy a lotto ticket or a bottle of wine
          <br />
          They tell me age is my restriction
          <br />
          I’m tied down by helpless youth
          <br />
          How am I to change the world
          <br />
          When I’m barred from voting booths
          <br />
          <br />
          But I can still hold my head up
          <br />
          I can still look you in the eye
          <br />
          Because you can’t rule the world if you’re afraid
          <br />
          Fear just makes it harder to survive
          <br />
          <br />
          If I can’t hope for a path
          <br />
          Then I’ll carve my own
          <br />
          Put pennies in my pocket
          <br />
          ‘Til I find the answers I’m owed
          <br />
          <br />
          A dingy OPEN sign
          <br />
          It sits above the door
          <br />
          Where I work until youth
          <br />
          Has a hold on me no more
          <br />
          One day I’ll lock up
          <br />
          Dim the neon sign
          <br />
          And I’ll live the life I planned
          <br />
          Leaving my youth far behind
        </p>
