I’m practically invisible 

and that feeling’s sweet

knowing I can see them

but they can’t see me



dangling from branches

holding onto leaves

waiting for my moment

to harvest and to feast



cling on to their socks

sit upon their feet

find a place to plant yourself

a place you can’t be seen



bury a head into soft skin

drunk on blood the room starts to spin

too bad your host is itching away 

too bad your host doesn’t want you to stay

too bad you’re picked out and thrown away        </p>
