Chasing The Sun
One thing is certain

The sky is blue

Except it isn’t

Not really

Not when the sun chases the moon



Between yesterday and tomorrow

The sky dances with color

Bathing him in orange

In purples and pinks

Bathing him in the knowledge 

That there’s more out there than he thinks



He’s standing on a balcony

Never has he left the third floor

But now he can’t help but wonder

If he’s missing out on much more



How many other colors does the sky have to offer?

How many other sunsets can one boy discover?



With the city streets below him

He dangles his feet in open air

In order to find a future

He hopes is waiting out there



He’ll catch a lift with the moon

He’s never been one to run

Finally catching up on all the years

He should have spent chasing the sun        </p>
