          Chasing The Sun

          One thing is certain
          <br />
          The sky is blue
          <br />
          Except it isn’t
          <br />
          Not really
          <br />
          Not when the sun chases the moon
          <br />
          <br />
          Between yesterday and tomorrow
          <br />
          The sky dances with color
          <br />
          Bathing him in orange
          <br />
          In purples and pinks
          <br />
          Bathing him in the knowledge
          <br />
          That there’s more out there than he thinks
          <br />
          <br />
          He’s standing on a balcony
          <br />
          Never has he left the third floor
          <br />
          But now he can’t help but wonder
          <br />
          If he’s missing out on much more
          <br />
          <br />
          How many other colors does the sky have to offer?
          <br />
          How many other sunsets can one boy discover?
          <br />
          <br />
          With the city streets below him
          <br />
          He dangles his feet in open air
          <br />
          In order to find a future
          <br />
          He hopes is waiting out there
          <br />
          <br />
          He’ll catch a lift with the moon
          <br />
          He’s never been one to run
          <br />
          Finally catching up on all the years
          <br />
          He should have spent chasing the sun
