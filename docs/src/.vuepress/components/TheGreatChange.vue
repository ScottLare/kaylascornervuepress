          The Great Change

          I'm standing in between a new beginning and an unexpected end
          <br />
          Soaking in the antagonizing moments before a change
          <br />
          The moments that feel like the end of summer
          <br />
          When you're ready for the bright sun to sink behind the clouds and for
          verdant leaves to meet their demise
          <br />
          <br />
          The image is exciting. The image is tragic.
          <br />
          But aren't all endings tragic?
          <br />
          Maybe not.
          <br />
          One must admit that scarlet leaves are just as alluring as their
          predecessor
          <br />
          They're the color of fire
          <br />
          Fire that caught and burned down the previous season as if it never
          existed at all
          <br />
          <br />
          I hope my previous seasons don't burn down
          <br />
          But if they do
          <br />
          I can hold onto the steadfast knowledge
          <br />
          That summer comes around again
