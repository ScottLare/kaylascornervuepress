          The Great Change

I'm standing in between a new beginning and an unexpected end

Soaking in the antagonizing moments before a change

The moments that feel like the end of summer

When you're ready for the bright sun to sink behind the clouds and for verdant leaves to meet their demise



The image is exciting. The image is tragic.

But aren't all endings tragic?

Maybe not.

One must admit that scarlet leaves are just as alluring as their predecessor

They're the color of fire

Fire that caught and burned down the previous season as if it never existed at all



I hope my previous seasons don't burn down

But if they do

I can hold onto the steadfast knowledge

That summer comes around again        </p>
