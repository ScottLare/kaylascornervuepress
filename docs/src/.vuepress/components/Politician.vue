          The large flatscreen T.V. was perched on a mahogany desk in Jasmine's
          bedroom. It was angled just so, perfect for viewing from her
          king-sized bed. Jasmine would crawl into the silky sheets after long
          days and connect her phone to the flatscreen. Falling asleep with
          Friends playing in the background was a habit no one would be able to
          convince her to break.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unfortunately, she wasn't curled up in the velvet comforter spread out
          oh so temptingly on the bed. She was in the bathroom, close enough to
          hear the television, balancing on one slim leg, while the other was
          propped up in the sink.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Last night the mayor finally gave a major address regarding the
          claims of corruption being made towards him,” the television remarked,
          echoing the words of the newscaster talking live from across the city.
          “He called the evidence presented ‘faulty and unreliable’ and
          seemingly explained the misunderstanding. Here are some highlights
          from Mayor Sykes’ latest denial…”
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine strained her ears to hear the T.V. better. She cursed herself
          for not staying up last night and watching the speech for herself. She
          was exhausted from cleaning her apartment all day. She usually didn't
          put so much effort into one client, but this job had to be perfect. It
          had to be perfect, and in true Jasmine Owens fashion she was running
          late.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I don't feel threatened by any of the accusations because none of
          them are true,” said the mayor. “To accuse someone of involving
          themselves with a drug cartel? Especially someone of my status? What
          would I have to benefit from that? What would New York City have to
          benefit from that? My first priority is always my city. As you all
          know I’ve donated half of my funds to-”
          <br />
          <br />
          “Youth shelters and climate change,” Jasmine said dryly, in unison
          with the man on T.V. Jackson Sykes always managed to shove his
          generosity down the throats of his citizens. After two years of him
          advertising the same mantra, claiming he’s passionate about child
          homelessness and climate change, it’s laughable that homelessness and
          pollution have only increased in New York since the beginning of his
          term. No one mentioned that though. No one ever did.
          <br />
          <br />
          There was a shrill ding from the buzzer, making Jasmine jump. In the
          process, the razor slipped, leaving a small cut on her leg where blood
          already began to gather.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Damnit!” Jasmine muttered, dabbing at the wound with toilet paper.
          She looked inside her bathroom cabinet and found only Spongebob band
          aids. She figured her client would rather have blood stained sheets
          than look at her with a cartoon sponge on her leg, so she opted for
          the former. She wondered if Walmart sold sexy band aids. She could use
          some of those.
          <br />
          <br />
          She glanced in the mirror one last time. Her dark hair hung around her
          face, artfully messy, and the blue contacts she wore made her pale
          skin glow. Her black lingerie was ripped in places from a customer who
          had been a bit too greedy, but she still looked good. Who was she
          kidding? She looked amazing. She had to look amazing, it was what she
          was getting paid for after all.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Come on up,” Jasmine said into the buzzer, hoping her response didn’t
          come too late. She was well aware that her client didn’t want to be
          seen. She prayed that her tardiness didn’t scare him off.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thankfully, that wasn’t the case. A few minutes later there was a
          knock at her door. Jasmine slipped into a silk black robe and put a
          sly smile on her face. It was her first character. The one she fell
          back on before she knew what her customer wanted her to be.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Hello,” she said, opening the ivory door to let the man in. He was
          barely recognizable, with black hair covering his face, and a large
          tracksuit that he drowned in. He could have been mistaken for homeless
          if glanced at quickly on the street. Jasmine knew better. No poor man
          held himself the way the man before her did. No poor man ever offered
          her three thousand dollars for a job either. Although unspoken, she
          knew what the money meant. This is a secret and it’s going to stay
          that way.
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine had rolled her eyes when the money had appeared in her PayPal
          account. She kept all her jobs a secret. That’s part of why she was so
          well respected. To give her double her asking price was pretentious,
          but she wasn’t going to turn it down. Especially not from this man.
          <br />
          <br />
          “How have you been Mr. Sykes?” Asked Jasmine in a voice that wasn’t
          her own. “It’s been awhile.”
          <br />
          <br />
          “I’ve been up to the usual. Hanging out with friends, visiting
          family-and oh yeah- running an entire city. So I’d say it’s been
          pretty damn stressful,” retorted Jackson Sykes impatiently.
          <br />
          <br />
          Not doing a very good job of it, Jasmine thought to herself. She
          ignored his irritated demeanor, taking out her phone. “I heard the
          speech you made last night. It totally blows that you have to
          constantly explain yourself to everyone. They voted you in. They
          should trust
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine didn’t believe any of it. In fact, she had her own suspicions
          about how Sykes really got into office. She didn’t voice them though.
          She voiced what she knew the mayor wanted to hear.
          <br />
          <br />
          Her words had the effect she had been hoping for. The man’s body
          language changed almost immediately. Still proud and self-important,
          but more relaxed now. As if it was instinct for him to preen at any
          form of praise he received. Jasmine loved a man with a fragile ego. It
          made her job so much more fun.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Take off that wig,” she demanded, leading the way to her bedroom.
          “You look absolutely ridiculous.”
          <br />
          <br />
          She heard Sykes huff from behind her, but he didn’t bite back.
          Disappointing. He knows how to control his temper. Must have been all
          those years of media training finally paying off. Yes, it made
          Jasmine’s plan harder. But not impossible. She loved a challenge.
          <br />
          <br />
          As she placed her phone on the mahogany desk, Jasmine made sure to
          have the sleeve of her robe fall down her shoulder. It looked
          accidental, not very scandalous at all, but that’s not how it would be
          perceived. Not when she was being paid to be scandalous.
          <br />
          <br />
          She turned to see that Sykes had indeed followed her instructions and
          taken off that awful black wig. Under it was a professional cut,
          orange hair short enough to look put together, but long enough to look
          easy going. It was calculated. Everything about the man in front of
          her was calculated. At least there was one thing he and Jasmine had in
          <br />
          <br />
          She spread out on the bed. Her toes pointed, to give her feet a more
          slender look. “What have you been up to Mr. Sykes?” She drew out the
          question. They loved it when she did that.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I’m not here to talk about myself,” Sykes responded, indifference
          dripping from his voice. “You’re a whore not a therapist.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine stopped. Sitting up she said, “This is my house and I refuse
          to be disrespected in it. I don’t care how much money you gave to me,
          I won’t hesitate to kick you out. I’m the best at my job and I have
          tons of other clients who have the decency to treat me with respect.
          You're not the only rich man who’s tired of his wife, you know.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Sykes ignored this. Men like him always seem to ignore things they
          don’t like.
          <br />
          <br />
          “For the most popular and praised whore in New York, I figured you’d
          be less uptight.” His hand snuck into his pocket and pulled out a tiny
          ziplock bag. It was filled with white powder. “This might help ya
          loosen up.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine raised her eyebrows at the drug he was offering her. He was
          making it too easy.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I forgot you had a thing for detta.” A lie. How could one forget that
          the man making laws for your city was a hopeless drug addict? “You
          probably don’t remember, but I’m not a fan.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Sykes shrugged, pouring the white powder on the desk. Jasmine held her
          breath, but fortunately Sykes was too desperate for a fix to notice
          the strategically placed phone.
          <br />
          <br />
          He inhaled deeply and glanced up at her, pupils blown wide. Detta
          worked quick. He was high and off his guard. Perfect. She now had the
          upper hand.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Where do you get it?” She asked, gesturing to the remnants of the
          drug on her desk.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I thought it wasn’t your thing?” Sykes responded, grinning at her.
          His eyes were red. Jasmine almost felt sympathy for the man.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Just curious.” She batted her eyelashes.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I have connections to these guys from South America.” Sykes
          explained, obviously unaware of what he was saying. “It’s crazy! They
          import drugs through Governors Island and all I have to do is sign
          something. They give me a percentage you know! And an endless supply!
          I made five million last year! Five million! With that kind of money I
          could buy you to be my own personal-”
          <br />
          <br />
          Sykes never got to finish his sentence. He was interrupted by his
          stomach, who obviously hadn’t gotten along with the detta as well as
          his brain had. Jasmine watched in disgust as New York’s mayor spilled
          his guts on her bedroom floor. She was just grateful she sprung for
          the hardwood flooring instead of carpet.
          <br />
          <br />
          “I think you should leave Mr. Sykes,” Jasmine said coolly.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Now wait a minute!” Sykes wiped his mouth with his sleeve. “I paid
          you three thousand dollars to do your job and you haven’t done a
          single thing!”
          <br />
          <br />
          “It certainly won’t be enjoyable for either of us to perform anything
          with you sick Mr. Sykes. We can reschedule.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Jackson Sykes seemed content with that, nodding once and stumbling
          towards the entrance of the apartment. Jasmine watched him,
          unimpressed. If things go as planned, Sykes wouldn’t have to worry
          about rescheduling.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Don’t forget your wig.” Jasmine smirked, handing the man his stringy
          mess of hair. “Wouldn’t want anyone noticing you.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Her words seemed to bring Sykes to a brief sense of sobriety. “You
          won’t tell anybody will you? About what I told you? I paid you to keep
          my secrets! I’ll sue if you say a word!”
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine responded with a smile. “Keeping secrets is my job sir.”
          <br />
          <br />
          Sykes seemed satisfied by that, staggering out the door. He slammed
          the door, unable to notice the picture Jasmine had snapped of him
          before he exited.
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine clicked her tongue. “Too bad I’m quitting.” With two taps of
          her thumb the voice memo on her phone was sent to the New York Times.
          <br />
          <br />
          “That’s what you get for puking on my floor,” Jasmine said to the
          door, grabbing a mop from her closet. The work around here never did
          seem to
        </p>

        <p class="text-red-400 font-bold text-center text-3xl p-4 mr-56">***</p>

        >
          Finally, Jasmine was in her bed. Wrapped in her velvet comforter and
          watching mindless T.V. She was pretty sure she was in paradise.
          <br />
          <br />
          The feeling only grew when she heard her phone buzz. It wasn’t from a
          client. She didn’t get those anymore. It was an email from the bank.
          <br />
          <br />
          All loans and added interest are officially paid off. You withdrew
          fifty thousand dollars and have paid back in full-
          <br />
          <br />
          Jasmine didn’t bother finishing the rest of the email. She shrieked,
          jumping up on her bed, happy dancing to the sound of the Friends theme
          song.
          <br />
          <br />
          “Thank you for prepaying Sykes.” Jasmine said to herself, wondering if
          the mayor would have ever guessed that his money was going to be used
          to pay back college loans.
          <br />
          <br />
          Out of curiosity, Jasmine typed his name into her computer. The
          headlines began to pop up and Jasmine’s grin grew as she scrolled
          down.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mayor Jackson Sykes admits to drug laundering through leaked tape...

          <br />
          Your taxes are paying for Sykes’ drug addiction? Click to listen to
          this shocking voice memo...
          <br />
          <br />
          Mayor Jackson Sykes was found on the streets of Manhattan, under the
          influence and in a lot of trouble…
          <br />
          <br />
          Sykes’ went from a perfect denial to behind bars in less than
          twenty-four hours. How America is in desperate need of intelligent
          politicians…
          <br />
          <br />
          Everyone on Twitter wanted to know who leaked the information. Who
          would stab Sykes in the back like that? Jasmine supposed she could
          come clean. She would probably be praised. Have her five seconds of
          fame.
          <br />
          <br />
          She sighed. It was too late for all that. Besides, she had a class
          tomorrow. Her degree in political science was waiting.
