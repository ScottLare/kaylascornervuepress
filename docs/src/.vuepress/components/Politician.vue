          The Politician
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="italic text-red-400 text-2xl">By: Kayla Lare</span>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          The large flatscreen T.V. was perched on a mahogany desk in Jasmine's
          bedroom. It was angled just so, perfect for viewing from her
          king-sized bed. Jasmine would crawl into the silky sheets after long
          days and connect her phone to the flatscreen. Falling asleep with
          Friends playing in the background was a habit no one would be able to
          convince her to break.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Unfortunately, she wasn't curled up in the velvet comforter spread out
          oh so temptingly on the bed. She was in the bathroom, close enough to
          hear the television, balancing on one slim leg, while the other was
          propped up in the sink.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Last night the mayor finally gave a major address regarding the
          claims of corruption being made towards him,” the television remarked,
          echoing the words of the newscaster talking live from across the city.
          “He called the evidence presented ‘faulty and unreliable’ and
          seemingly explained the misunderstanding. Here are some highlights
          from Mayor Sykes’ latest denial…”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine strained her ears to hear the T.V. better. She cursed herself
          for not staying up last night and watching the speech for herself. She
          was exhausted from cleaning her apartment all day. She usually didn't
          put so much effort into one client, but this job had to be perfect. It
          had to be perfect, and in true Jasmine Owens fashion she was running
          late.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “I don't feel threatened by any of the accusations because none of
          them are true,” said the mayor. “To accuse someone of involving
          themselves with a drug cartel? Especially someone of my status? What
          would I have to benefit from that? What would New York City have to
          benefit from that? My first priority is always my city. As you all
          know I’ve donated half of my funds to-”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Youth shelters and climate change,” Jasmine said dryly, in unison
          with the man on T.V. Jackson Sykes always managed to shove his
          generosity down the throats of his citizens. After two years of him
          advertising the same mantra, claiming he’s passionate about child
          homelessness and climate change, it’s laughable that homelessness and
          pollution have only increased in New York since the beginning of his
          term. No one mentioned that though. No one ever did.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          There was a shrill ding from the buzzer, making Jasmine jump. In the
          process, the razor slipped, leaving a small cut on her leg where blood
          already began to gather.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Damnit!” Jasmine muttered, dabbing at the wound with toilet paper.
          She looked inside her bathroom cabinet and found only Spongebob band
          aids. She figured her client would rather have blood stained sheets
          than look at her with a cartoon sponge on her leg, so she opted for
          the former. She wondered if Walmart sold sexy band aids. She could use
          some of those.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          She glanced in the mirror one last time. Her dark hair hung around her
          face, artfully messy, and the blue contacts she wore made her pale
          skin glow. Her black lingerie was ripped in places from a customer who
          had been a bit too greedy, but she still looked good. Who was she
          kidding? She looked amazing. She had to look amazing, it was what she
          was getting paid for after all.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Come on up,” Jasmine said into the buzzer, hoping her response didn’t
          come too late. She was well aware that her client didn’t want to be
          seen. She prayed that her tardiness didn’t scare him off.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Thankfully, that wasn’t the case. A few minutes later there was a
          knock at her door. Jasmine slipped into a silk black robe and put a
          sly smile on her face. It was her first character. The one she fell
          back on before she knew what her customer wanted her to be.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Hello,” she said, opening the ivory door to let the man in. He was
          barely recognizable, with black hair covering his face, and a large
          tracksuit that he drowned in. He could have been mistaken for homeless
          if glanced at quickly on the street. Jasmine knew better. No poor man
          held himself the way the man before her did. No poor man ever offered
          her three thousand dollars for a job either. Although unspoken, she
          knew what the money meant. This is a secret and it’s going to stay
          that way.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine had rolled her eyes when the money had appeared in her PayPal
          account. She kept all her jobs a secret. That’s part of why she was so
          well respected. To give her double her asking price was pretentious,
          but she wasn’t going to turn it down. Especially not from this man.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “How have you been Mr. Sykes?” Asked Jasmine in a voice that wasn’t
          her own. “It’s been awhile.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “I’ve been up to the usual. Hanging out with friends, visiting
          family-and oh yeah- running an entire city. So I’d say it’s been
          pretty damn stressful,” retorted Jackson Sykes impatiently.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Not doing a very good job of it, Jasmine thought to herself. She
          ignored his irritated demeanor, taking out her phone. “I heard the
          speech you made last night. It totally blows that you have to
          constantly explain yourself to everyone. They voted you in. They
          should trust
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine didn’t believe any of it. In fact, she had her own suspicions
          about how Sykes really got into office. She didn’t voice them though.
          She voiced what she knew the mayor wanted to hear.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Her words had the effect she had been hoping for. The man’s body
          language changed almost immediately. Still proud and self-important,
          but more relaxed now. As if it was instinct for him to preen at any
          form of praise he received. Jasmine loved a man with a fragile ego. It
          made her job so much more fun.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Take off that wig,” she demanded, leading the way to her bedroom.
          “You look absolutely ridiculous.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          She heard Sykes huff from behind her, but he didn’t bite back.
          Disappointing. He knows how to control his temper. Must have been all
          those years of media training finally paying off. Yes, it made
          Jasmine’s plan harder. But not impossible. She loved a challenge.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          As she placed her phone on the mahogany desk, Jasmine made sure to
          have the sleeve of her robe fall down her shoulder. It looked
          accidental, not very scandalous at all, but that’s not how it would be
          perceived. Not when she was being paid to be scandalous.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          She turned to see that Sykes had indeed followed her instructions and
          taken off that awful black wig. Under it was a professional cut,
          orange hair short enough to look put together, but long enough to look
          easy going. It was calculated. Everything about the man in front of
          her was calculated. At least there was one thing he and Jasmine had in
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          She spread out on the bed. Her toes pointed, to give her feet a more
          slender look. “What have you been up to Mr. Sykes?” She drew out the
          question. They loved it when she did that.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “I’m not here to talk about myself,” Sykes responded, indifference
          dripping from his voice. “You’re a whore not a therapist.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine stopped. Sitting up she said, “This is my house and I refuse
          to be disrespected in it. I don’t care how much money you gave to me,
          I won’t hesitate to kick you out. I’m the best at my job and I have
          tons of other clients who have the decency to treat me with respect.
          You're not the only rich man who’s tired of his wife, you know.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Sykes ignored this. Men like him always seem to ignore things they
          don’t like.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “For the most popular and praised whore in New York, I figured you’d
          be less uptight.” His hand snuck into his pocket and pulled out a tiny
          ziplock bag. It was filled with white powder. “This might help ya
          loosen up.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine raised her eyebrows at the drug he was offering her. He was
          making it too easy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “I forgot you had a thing for detta.” A lie. How could one forget that
          the man making laws for your city was a hopeless drug addict? “You
          probably don’t remember, but I’m not a fan.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Sykes shrugged, pouring the white powder on the desk. Jasmine held her
          breath, but fortunately Sykes was too desperate for a fix to notice
          the strategically placed phone.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          He inhaled deeply and glanced up at her, pupils blown wide. Detta
          worked quick. He was high and off his guard. Perfect. She now had the
          upper hand.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Where do you get it?” She asked, gesturing to the remnants of the
          drug on her desk.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “I thought it wasn’t your thing?” Sykes responded, grinning at her.
          His eyes were red. Jasmine almost felt sympathy for the man.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Just curious.” She batted her eyelashes.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “I have connections to these guys from South America.” Sykes
          explained, obviously unaware of what he was saying. “It’s crazy! They
          import drugs through Governors Island and all I have to do is sign
          something. They give me a percentage you know! And an endless supply!
          I made five million last year! Five million! With that kind of money I
          could buy you to be my own personal-”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Sykes never got to finish his sentence. He was interrupted by his
          stomach, who obviously hadn’t gotten along with the detta as well as
          his brain had. Jasmine watched in disgust as New York’s mayor spilled
          his guts on her bedroom floor. She was just grateful she sprung for
          the hardwood flooring instead of carpet.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “I think you should leave Mr. Sykes,” Jasmine said coolly.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Now wait a minute!” Sykes wiped his mouth with his sleeve. “I paid
          you three thousand dollars to do your job and you haven’t done a
          single thing!”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “It certainly won’t be enjoyable for either of us to perform anything
          with you sick Mr. Sykes. We can reschedule.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jackson Sykes seemed content with that, nodding once and stumbling
          towards the entrance of the apartment. Jasmine watched him,
          unimpressed. If things go as planned, Sykes wouldn’t have to worry
          about rescheduling.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Don’t forget your wig.” Jasmine smirked, handing the man his stringy
          mess of hair. “Wouldn’t want anyone noticing you.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Her words seemed to bring Sykes to a brief sense of sobriety. “You
          won’t tell anybody will you? About what I told you? I paid you to keep
          my secrets! I’ll sue if you say a word!”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine responded with a smile. “Keeping secrets is my job sir.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Sykes seemed satisfied by that, staggering out the door. He slammed
          the door, unable to notice the picture Jasmine had snapped of him
          before he exited.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine clicked her tongue. “Too bad I’m quitting.” With two taps of
          her thumb the voice memo on her phone was sent to the New York Times.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “That’s what you get for puking on my floor,” Jasmine said to the
          door, grabbing a mop from her closet. The work around here never did
          seem to
        </p>

        <p class="text-red-400 font-bold text-center text-3xl p-4 mr-56">***</p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Finally, Jasmine was in her bed. Wrapped in her velvet comforter and
          watching mindless T.V. She was pretty sure she was in paradise.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          The feeling only grew when she heard her phone buzz. It wasn’t from a
          client. She didn’t get those anymore. It was an email from the bank.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          All loans and added interest are officially paid off. You withdrew
          fifty thousand dollars and have paid back in full-
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Jasmine didn’t bother finishing the rest of the email. She shrieked,
          jumping up on her bed, happy dancing to the sound of the Friends theme
          song.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          “Thank you for prepaying Sykes.” Jasmine said to herself, wondering if
          the mayor would have ever guessed that his money was going to be used
          to pay back college loans.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Out of curiosity, Jasmine typed his name into her computer. The
          headlines began to pop up and Jasmine’s grin grew as she scrolled
          down.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Mayor Jackson Sykes admits to drug laundering through leaked tape...
        </p>

          Mayor Jackson Sykes was found on the streets of Manhattan, under the
          influence and in a lot of trouble…
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Sykes’ went from a perfect denial to behind bars in less than
          twenty-four hours. How America is in desperate need of intelligent
          politicians…
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          Everyone on Twitter wanted to know who leaked the information. Who
          would stab Sykes in the back like that? Jasmine supposed she could
          come clean. She would probably be praised. Have her five seconds of
          fame.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-2xl p-4 mr-56 text-left">
          She sighed. It was too late for all that. Besides, she had a class
          tomorrow. Her degree in political science was waiting.
