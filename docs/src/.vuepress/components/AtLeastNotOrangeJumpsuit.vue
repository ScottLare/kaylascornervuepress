          I don’t want to write something heartbreaking
          <br />
          That’s cliche, it’s unoriginal
          <br />
          An easy way to gain your audience’s sympathy
          <br />
          To pull at their heartstrings like a puppet master
          <br />
          Commanding them to applaud you and your screwed up life
          <br />
          Telling them to pity you but not telling them your role
          <br />
          For you paint yourself as the victim
          <br />
          But the black and whites blend together
          <br />
          And it turns out your masterpiece
          <br />
          Well, it’s much greyer than you’d like it to be
          <br />
          <br />
          Poetry appears vulnerable
          <br />
          But it’s webbed with lies,
          <br />
          Half-truths
          <br />
          Flowery cruelty
          <br />
          It lines the bars of my prison
          <br />
          The one I built from ambivalent thought
          <br />
          The one made of confliction and drama
          <br />
          Drama I craft for the sake of something to do
          <br />
          No longer etched into cement with my poetry
          <br />
          But outside the wall of my cage
          <br />
          Where it runs wild
          <br />
          Where I can’t catch it
          <br />
          Where it drives me insane
          <br />
          <br />
          Pretty words can hang like a mask around the face
          <br />
          Making my cage invisible even to those who read my thoughts on a page
          <br />
          It’s funny how trapped you can feel when you know how to escape
          <br />
          But the safety of a cage is more comfortable than confronting the
          pieces in this game
          <br />
          <br />
          The game I built ‘cause I’m not the victim here today
          <br />
          I deserve to rot in my prison of instinct and dumb mistakes
          <br />
          Messing up is fine if the consequences are facable
          <br />
          Not too traceable
          <br />
          Unfortunately I’m incapable
          <br />
          Of breaking out of this jail
          <br />
          It’s not stockholm syndrome
          <br />
          I swear
          <br />
          Locked up with my secrets and lies, I’ve got so much to lose
          <br />
          At least…
          <br />
          At least I’m not wearing an orange jumpsuit
