At Least I’m Not Wearing An Orange Jumpsuit

I don’t want to write something heartbreaking

That’s cliche, it’s unoriginal

An easy way to gain your audience’s sympathy 

To pull at their heartstrings like a puppet master

Commanding them to applaud you and your screwed up life

Telling them to pity you but not telling them your role

For you paint yourself as the victim

But the black and whites blend together

And it turns out your masterpiece

Well, it’s much greyer than you’d like it to be 



Poetry appears vulnerable

But it’s webbed with lies,

Half-truths

Flowery cruelty 

It lines the bars of my prison

The one I built from ambivalent thought

The one made of confliction and drama

Drama I craft for the sake of something to do

No longer etched into cement with my poetry

But outside the wall of my cage 

Where it runs wild 

Where I can’t catch it

Where it drives me insane



Pretty words can hang like a mask around the face

Making my cage invisible even to those who read my thoughts on a page

It’s funny how trapped you can feel when you know how to escape

But the safety of a cage is more comfortable than confronting the pieces in this game



The game I built ‘cause I’m not the victim here today

I deserve to rot in my prison of instinct and dumb mistakes

Messing up is fine if the consequences are facable 

Not too traceable

Unfortunately I’m incapable

Of breaking out of this jail

It’s not stockholm syndrome 

I swear

Locked up with my secrets and lies, I’ve got so much to lose

At least…

At least I’m not wearing an orange jumpsuit         </p>
