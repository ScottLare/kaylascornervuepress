Winter Strolls in the South

My nose burns

In a pleasant sort of way

Every time I inhale

The crisp air that surrounds me

Crisp, not cold

Cold is sharp and unwelcoming

Crisp is refreshing

And refreshing it is

Autumn leaves in December

Birds discussing their Christmas plans

Nothing has died

Yet everything has changed        </p>
