          I’m a storyteller. A descendant of Homer and Shakesphere alike. A
          devout follower of Byron and Keats. Ink flows through my veins and
          legends fall from my lips. I practice the intricate craft of creating
          worlds through sentences. Creating characters and emotions through

          “Penny, Mother says to stop talking to imaginary people and go milk
          Achilles.” It was Arabella, my younger sister, watching me from the
          doorway. She was only nine, but she carried herself just how our
          mother had taught us, like a proper young lady.
        </p>



        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “I’m not talking to imaginary people.” I grumbled, grabbing the milk
          bucket that lay by the door. It smelled atrocious. Ugh. Wrong bucket.
          “I was monologuing.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Arabella giggled as I dumped the waste out our front window and into
          the garden. Mom insisted that it fertilized the soil. I insisted that
          I’d rather we yielded less crops. We ended up compromising. We use our
          waste to fertilize the soil and Mom doesn’t marry me off to the next
          farmer that knocks on our door.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “Mono-log-ing.” Arabella pronounced each syllable slowly, looking at
          me for approval. I smiled at her before turning around and searching
          the kitchen cupboard for the right bucket.

          Milking cows is a dreary affair. Achilles (Mom let me name her) was
          the only cow we owned and she had a crooked heel (Ha! get it?) that
          often made the act of merely standing still a very tiresome effort for
          her. Thus, in order to get milk, I had to position Achilles in a way
          that allowed for me to crawl underneath her and properly tug at her
          utters. It usually ended up with me flat on my back with the milk
          bucket on my chest, at the complete mercy of the cow, who could simply
          crush me if she decided that she no longer felt like standing. Yes,
          this indeed was the glamorous life I led.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          After I collected the milk, narrowly missing being clobbered by
          Achilles’ hindlegs, I hurried back toward the house. House was a
          generous word I suppose. It was a small, wooden structure, with two
          rooms and a garden. We had a hen named Mrs. Featherhead (Arabella got
          to name her) and she often ran around the property, squawking like a
          deranged alarm. I told Mom it was her that scared off all the suitors.
          Mom told me it was my crooked front teeth.

          I walk back into the house carrying Achilles’ milk. Mom was there in
          the kitchen, wrapping up the last of what looked like a batch of fresh
          strawberries. When she saw me, she gestured impatiently, motioning for
          me to set down the milk and help her.

          parcel of strawberries into a basket as if they were made of glass.

          less.”

          blood-related or a disabled cow. I once asked Mom if I could marry
          him. She thinks he wouldn’t make a proper husband. I think he’s the
          only bearable person in this village.

          I realized I was doing the thing Mom often chastises me about. A waste
          of air is what she likes to call it. I check to see if Emi is still
          listening and he is, his attention now completely turned away from the
          strawberries and focused on what I’m saying.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">

            unravel for ourselves. A good story keeps us guessing, surprises and
            surpasses our expectations. I do not like prophecies because I do

          I was still replaying Emi’s words in my head when I bumped into an
          elderly gentleman. He looked like a beggar, with torn clothes and dirt
          smudged on his cheeks. I realized that between the dopey grin
          plastered on my face and the distinct sound of coins jingling in my
          pocket, I must seem like the perfect target to steal from. I try to
          mimic the expression I’ve seen Mom make when I’ve forgotten to get the
          drywood for the stove fire. Absolutely, bone-numbingly, terrifying.

          It must not have the same effect when I do it, for the beggar did not
          look phased. Instead he gave me an open-mouth smile, displaying about
          five teeth in total, all of which were varying shades of grey. I was
          suddenly very grateful for my set of crooked front teeth.

          after my father died and the crown came to take his possessions, I hid

          It was Arabella’s eleventh birthday and I wanted it to be perfect. I
          used Achilles’ milk and Mrs. Featherheads eggs to bake a slightly
          warped version of a birthday cake. I placed eleven strawberries on the

          I had a present planned for her. A new story. Over the past two years
          I’d become rather popular in the village for my storytelling. It
          started when one day I was loudly telling Emi a short legend I had
          conjured up on my way to his stand. People had gathered around to
          listen to me recite a tale of epic adventure and tragic love. They
          asked me where I had read this story and I told them that it was me
          who had come up with it. The crowd was back at Emi’s stand the next
          day, a couple more villagers having joined them. It became like that
          everyday, the crowd growing larger and coins beginning to drop into
          the pockets of my dress. Mom was so pleased she no longer insisted
          that I be married off immediately. I had gotten quite old. Most
          sixteen year olds are bearing their fourth child by now. I didn’t
          mind. I wasn’t born to be a mother, I was born to be a storyteller.

          The story I had crafted for Arabella’s eleventh birthday was my best
          yet. It had taken me months to finish, but I was more than pleased
          with the results. This morning, after a piece of cake and my
          insistence to braid Arabella’s hair into neat dark plaits, we headed
          out to the village, Mom accompanying us. We found Emi waiting by his
          stand as usual. He waved at us. I smiled. I did that a lot when he was
          around.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Much like my storytelling, Emi had grown much over the past two years.
          He was much taller and much broader than he had been as a child. He
          also wasn’t married, despite being seventeen. I tried not to think
          about why. There’s danger in hoping.

          a beam from the smaller girl in return. “Heard it was your birthday,
          little one.” Emi crouched down so he was eye level with the birthday
          girl. “Make sure you don’t share that with anyone else. You’re
          supposed to be selfish on your birthday.” He winked and stood back up.
          Arabella gave me a look as if to say when are you going to put a ring
          on him? Then she scurried off, joining her friend Orla, whose mother
          often bought Mrs. Featherhead’s eggs.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “Do you have a story planned for today?” Emi asked me, thanking my
          mother as she handed him a basket full of strawberries. “I’m hoping
          for the one about Igor the Mighty again. It’s my favorite.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I shook my head. “I made something special in honor of my favorite
          person’s birthday.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Emi cocked his own head in mock confusion. “It’s not my birthday.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I smiled, hoping that the faint red of my cheeks would be mistaken as
          a result of the summer heat. “I better get going. I can see that a
          crowd is beginning to gather already.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Emi gave me an encouraging grin and Mom hugged me. Before she pulled
          away I heard her give a little gasp of surprise. “It can’t be.” She
          said, staring at something over my shoulder.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I turned to see that the deep purple of a royal flag was being flown
          just a few yards in front of us. A carriage was being pulled through
          our village. A village that had certainly never seen a carriage
          before, and definitely not a royal one.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          The villagers gasped as the carriage rolled toward the center of the
          market, stopping before the little makeshift crates that I had started
          using as my stage. The footman put a hand on the regal white horses as
          if to tell them that they shouldn’t be scared of the dirty people that
          were beginning to gather around them. He then opened the carriage door
          and two soldiers got out followed by a stubby looking man and...oh
          you’ve got to be joking.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Two more soldiers who had been sitting on the back ledge of the
          carriage came around so that the Prince was flocked on all sides by
          security.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “What is he doing here?” Emi whispered to me, having come out from
          behind his stand to get a better look.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I didn’t answer. All I could think of was the old soothsayer and his
          last words to me. For it is she who slaughters the one on the throne.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">

          The stubby man turned out to be some sort of servant to the Prince. He
          declared himself the Royal Advisor and introduced the Prince as if we
          weren’t all aware of who stood before us. He paused and gave us time
          to bow before plowing onward.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “Across our kingdom there has been whispering of a storyteller, the
          best of our generation. The Prince wished to come and watch him. To
          judge his wit and his imagination for himself.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          The Prince leaned over and whispered something into the Royal
          Advisor’s ear. The Royal Advisor gave an awkward cough. “Oh excuse me.
          Her. Penelope Cloverfield. Is she here?”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I gulped. I was never nervous telling my stories. It was unbecoming of
          a storyteller to stutter or pause when they were speaking. But this
          was the Prince, here to judge the girl who was destined to destroy him
          or a member of his family. How could I possibly act nonchalant when I
          knew the ending of this story. When I knew that this tale was a
          tragedy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Emi squeezed my hand and my mother whispered “Go on.” I stepped out of
          the crowd shakily, revealing myself. I was wearing a stained, rumpled
          dress and sweaty skin. The fabled storyteller in all her glory.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “I am Penelope Cloverfield.” I said with conviction. Like I said, a
          good storyteller never stutters. “I am honored that Your Highness has
          the desire to hear my tales, and that you have traveled so far to
          simply observe my craft.” I curtsy to both the Prince and the Royal
          Advisor and then the guards just to be safe.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I go to stand on my crates and gaze at the crowd. Arabella looks
          amazed, gazing at the Prince as if this were the best birthday present
          she could ever ask for. It irritated me. I didn’t want her going to
          bed thinking about the royal visit. I wanted her to go to bed dreaming
          of the legend I was about to tell. The legend that was made for her
          specifically. No Prince would get in the way of this. My nerves
          disappeared as I gazed at the crowd watching me expectantly. I was
          there to enchant them, and I knew exactly how to.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I am a storyteller. Ink flows through my veins and legends fall from
          my lips.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I began to speak, the new story flowing through the air as if I had
          spoken it a hundred times before. I can no longer see the crowd
          watching me. I am caught up in the world I speak of, caught up in the
          ivory castle and the princess made of glass. Caught up in her tragic
          curse, never able to touch or be touched. Caught up in her isolation,
          her sorrow, her one hope that leads to a terrifying adventure. I am
          faintly aware of the tears from my audience. They turn to smiles and
          back again to tears. I hear laughs and I hear gasps. It fuels the
          princess made of glass. Makes her story continue to unravel out of me
          until I’m not sure it’s my story anymore. It becomes lifelike, it’s
          own entity. By the time the story reaches the fatal words The End, my
          voice is hoarse and my eyes are closed. I blinked them open to observe
          my listeners. They were all staring at me, transfixed, obviously still
          trapped in the other world. My other world. I wait patiently as
          applause begins to break out before me.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “That was her best yet!” I heard an older woman whisper to her friend.

          The villagers began to come up to me, offering praise and coins. I
          took both graciously, already planning the new dress I would buy for
          Arabella. It would be scarlet, her favorite color.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          More people than I had expected came to hear me today. Word of the
          royal audience must have spread quickly. By the end of speaking with
          everyone my pockets were full of coins. I watched as the villagers
          drifted from me to the Prince, bowing and politely offering their
          thanks to him as well. It was weird that they were coming to me before
          him. I hoped he did not mind.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “Penny!” Arabella bounded over, her hand locked tightly around Orla’s
          wrist. “Oh Penny! You’ve outdone yourself! I’ve never heard anything
          so beautiful in my life.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Orla nodded in agreement, her emerald eyes never straying from the
          Prince. “He looked so impressed! I bet he’s going to hire you as the
          royal storyteller or something. How cool would that be?”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I laughed. “The story wasn’t for him. It was for Bella.” I ruffled my
          younger sister's hair. “I’m glad you two enjoyed it. Orla, why don’t
          you go ask your mother if you can come over for dinner tonight. I
          heard Mother say something about cooking up lamb.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Orla and Arabella both cheered and raced off to their moms who were
          chatting animatedly. I watched Mom’s hands swing as she talked and
          wondered vaguely if I did the same.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “You love her so much.” Emi’s sudden words didn’t catch me by
          surprise. I had been waiting for him to approach me. “You could hear
          it. In every word you spoke. Every syllable was for Arabella.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          He sounded amazed. I turned to look at him, finding his brown eyes
          watching me in a way that made my stomach flip over.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “Of course.” I tell him, choosing my words carefully. “Have you never
          loved someone like that? So completely?”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Emi opened his mouth. “Well actually,” he began, as if he was dying to
          say the words that followed. I was dying to hear them. Words never
          seemed so precious as they did in that moment. Before Emi could
          continue though, someone cleared their throat.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Emi and I both swung around to face the Prince. We both immediately
          dropped into low bows.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “Thank you so much, Your Highness.” I say quickly. I should have gone
          to him first, not waited until he came to me. How could I have
          forgotten? I prayed he wasn’t offended.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          He didn’t seem to be. Instead, he offered me a kind smile. “Thank you,
          Madam Cloverfield. I’ve been told tales from far and wide, but never
          have I been told one that touched me so deeply.” He turned to Mom who
          had come to join us, followed by Arabella, Orla, and Orla’s mother.
          “You must be very proud.”
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          Mom nodded, flustered. I’ve never seen Mom flustered. I almost
          laughed.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “It was for me.” Arabella spoke up proudly. “It’s my birthday present

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          The Prince patted her on the head. “Happy birthday dear. You must be
          very extraordinary indeed to have been granted such a lovely gift.”

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          The Royal Advisor shook my hand ardently, his eyes watery. “Absolutely
          fantastic.” He praised. “The best I’ve ever seen.”

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">

          “What are your plans for the night?” The Prince asked abruptly.

          “I would love for the rest of my family to hear you.” The Prince

          “We were going to celebrate tonight.” I told him quickly. “My sister's

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl italic">
          Everyone looked at me in shock. Emi was watching me cautiously,
          Arabella with raised eyebrows. Mom looked like she wanted to strangle

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl italic">
          “You are all welcome” The Prince said, unfazed by my rude dismissal.

          At this, Arabella and Orla let out identical squeals. Orla looked

          “Of course we will come.” Mom responded, before I could turn the
          Prince down again. “It would be an honor.”

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl italic">
          The Prince nodded. “I’ll send for a carriage to pick you up two hours

          With that he gave us a small bow and walked back to his carriage, the

          I think back to every prophecy I’d ever read about. How each one had

          “It’s a great boast.” He said, giving me a warm smile almost identical
          to his son’s. “To say that a mind like yours was born in this kingdom.

          royal visitors.”

          “We’ll have your stories printed of course.” The king continued. “The
          books will be translated too, Africa and Asia should not be left
          forgotten. How does that sound?” He looked at me as if half expecting
          me to fall to my knees and start weeping with gratitude.

          The words haunt me as I gaze at the royal family that I’m kneeling
          before. Prophecies are inescapable. No matter my answer, my destiny
          awaited me. Why should I turn down the world if turning it down might
          possibly result in the destruction I’d been told about? But what if it
          was my selfish action of staying that resulted in the prophecies'
          fulfillment? I turned these thoughts over in my brain, almost certain
          that I would go mad before I could even give the king a response. The
          long silence began to purse lips as everyone wondered why I had yet to
          speak a word.

          As I hurried along the corridor, pink flowers stuffed into the sleeve
          of my dress in order to protect the royals from any dangerous fumes, I
          bumped into the Prince. Well not really “bumped”. Usually our
          interactions go something like this. He sees me and calls out my name.
          I immediately panic and pray that I won’t accidently slaughter him in
          the next five minutes of conversation. He asks me why I’m acting so
          odd. I tell him I’m tired and then make a feeble excuse about going to

          “I was wondering if you would accompany me to the gardens.” The Prince

          I tentatively took it. I wished that cursed soothsayer had given me
          more information about how I would manage to murder a royal family
          member. If he told me it was going to happen in the gardens at least I
          would be prepared. That was the problem with prophecies. They had the
          audacity to spoil the ending of stories but didn’t even have the
          decency to give any context.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl italic">
          The gardens were beautiful. It was the middle of spring and the rich
          soil was bursting with colors. Bright pink peonies draped over the
          dirt path, as if bowing to the Prince. I tried not to imagine a
          tragedy occurring in such a beautiful place. Beauty and tragedy often
          come hand in hand. It was what made the most alluring stories. What
          made people weep.

          The Prince stopped by a white stone bench and took a seat. He gestured

          He pulled out an envelope from his pocket and handed it to me. The

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl italic">
          “I apologize.” the Prince said, not a hint of remorse in his tone. “It
          was technically not addressed to you but to the Clover Princess.
          Little Rosie saw the title and thought she was receiving her first
          letter. She was very disappointed, but I have a feeling you will not
          be.”

          I didn’t know what he meant by that, so I fixed my gaze back on the
          letter. Indeed, on the front of the envelope was not my name but the
          words To My Clover Princess. The scrawl was untidy but carefully
          drawn, as if the sender’s hand wasn’t used to writing. There was a
          blot of ink that smudged the r in Princess. I pulled the letter out
          carefully.

          There were tears stinging my eyes, but I had no desire to shed them in
          front of the Prince. If it hadn’t been Emi, hadn’t been me, I would be
          swooning. A woman stuck between following two dreams. Stuck between
          two great romances. It was a concept I’ve played with before, putting
          my heroes through agony and missed chances. It was all very enjoyable
          when it wasn’t happening to you. Perhaps I owed a personal apology to
          my characters. Perhaps I was too cruel to them.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          I turned to him, my eyebrows knitting themselves together. “I thought

          At least the Prince had the courtesy to turn slightly pink. “She did,
          and then she showed it to me because she was curious about who this
          Emi fellow was.” Upon seeing that his explanation did not ease my
          expression he continued quickly. “Of course I delivered it to you
          immediately after I figured out who it was for, I’m so sorry if you
          thought I was being invasive or-”

          I interrupted him. Which honestly? Probably should have gotten me a

          The Prince seemed bothered by this. “Yes but it was rude. You deserve
          an apology.” There was silence, both of us lost in our own thoughts.
          After a couple of minutes, he spoke again. “I consider us friends,
          Madam Cloverfield.” He sounded cautious, as if expecting me to jump to
          my feet and deny it. “I see the look on your face as you wander these
          halls day after day. You smile when you are with your sister and you
          smile when you are telling stories, but alone you look so burdened.
          Watching you read this letter was the first time I’ve seen a semblance
          of happiness in your face since you’ve arrived. I wish for my friends
          to be happy, and if I have some power in making that happen, then I
          will.”

          I don’t trust myself to respond. I feel my stomach twist at the
          thought of this man trusting me, trusting the woman who was fated to
          slay a member of his family. I was unhappy without Emi, that was true,
          but what had absolutely wrecked me was the thought of destroying a
          life, especially one from a family who had shown me nothing but
          continuous kindness.

        <p class="text-gray-900 text-1xl p-4 text-left sm:ml-0 sm:mr-56 sm:text-2xl">
          “I’ll give you a couple weeks to spend with him.” The Prince spoke
          with a sense of surety, as if he had already been planning this out.
          “Get married and then come back. I’m sure I can find your love
          employment nearer to the castle. You can be together and still
          continue your storytelling. It will all work out. I can make this all

          Mom never forgave me. Both her and Arabella believed that after I
          married Emi we would return to the palace. It was what I had told
          them, as well as what I had told the royal family. I would miss them,
          miss their generosity and their kindness. I would miss the beauty of
          watching Arabella outshine every marble pillar and gold cabinet she
          passed. I would miss the friendship I found in the Prince. Still, this
          only motivated me not to go back. Perhaps I could not prevent a
          prophecy, but I hoped to prolong it. I hoped that maybe fate would
          grow impatient and decide on another way to tell my story. Mom never
          knew of the prophecy, nor would she ever believe it. She grew old and
          tired, and on her deathbed she had yet to forgive me for taking away
          our chances at a better life.

          Arabella was much kinder. She never complained or asked about my
          refusal to go back. She eventually married a nobleman and moved to a
          nice villa in a wealthier town. Emi and I had dinner with her twice a
          week and I always found myself calling upon her when I had a free day.
          Those didn’t come often though, not after I became acquainted with
          motherhood.

          Emi was much like Mom when he heard that I would not be going back to
          the palace. He feared that I wouldn’t tell stories again, that I would
          miss out on the incredible chances being offered to me. I didn’t tell
          him that I wouldn’t be able to take those chances if I was locked up
          in a royal prison. Instead I told him that I didn’t want to miss the
          chance of being his wife, of having children. It was the truth,
          although not all of it, and for years I lived happily, completely in
          love with Emi and our children. It was a practical life, a good one,
          where daydreaming was replaced with reality, because when you have
          three sons, all your focus must be in the real world. My name wasn’t
          on the front of books and the whispers of my legends had faded. I
          stopped creating new ones, I didn’t have the time.

          It was not until Emi, still handsome even when he had fallen ill, left
          the world, that I realized. Not until I pulled out the letter Emi had
