Chalkboard Poetry

They love me for who I am

For how I act

How I speak

How I smile

They love me as long as I’m who they want me to be

And I want to be loved



I want to be loved

So I do as I’m told

Ignorance is bliss and they’ll never know

Mask myself in promises I’ll never keep

Bathe in their admiration and praise

Hoping it will fill the hole left in me



I want to be loved

More than I let on

Because desperate is pathetic

And pathetic receives no love at all

Desperate and pathetic 

Join the others I’ve erased

As I draw the person they want me to be

As I draw the person that isn’t me



I want to be loved

But parts of me can’t

The Desperate 

Pathetic

Diluted

Unhappy

They get erased from the blackboard

So no one can see

As I build myself from dust

Into chalkboard poetry
