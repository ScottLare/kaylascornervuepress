          There’s a hollow hole in the middle of my chest
          <br />
          A concave feeling, a dark twisted mess
          <br />
          <br />
          I reach down in my throat just to see if something’s there
          <br />
          My fingers grasp a heart, stone-cold and bare
          <br />
          Now I’m watching it lay
          <br />
          Watching it shadowed in the dark
          <br />
          Between the warmth of my hands
          <br />
          Dull fragments blown apart
          <br />
          I treat it like a puzzle, it’s the best I can do
          <br />
          I arrange the pieces together, fill the cracks with superglue
          <br />
          <br />
          Placing the somber organ back beneath my breast
          <br />
          I await the fire that is to come, that will burn within my chest
          <br />
          I go to sleep thinking of the light and its rays
          <br />
          I awake with the sinking feeling that nothing has changed
          <br />
          <br />
          Again my heart comes out
          <br />
          Out in open air
          <br />
          Where I can examine the damage
          <br />
          If it’s beyond all repair
          <br />
          The glue had not held
          <br />
          Though it was the best I could find
          <br />
          Broken remnants once again
          <br />
          All that’s left behind
          <br />
          <br />
          I find a different solution in the form of sellotape
          <br />
          No need to wait for it to dry, a quick fix for things that break
          <br />
          Stuffed into my body, the tape tickles at my bones
          <br />
          A small price to pay for when my heart starts to glow
          <br />
          Two weeks later and still nothing happened
          <br />
          The tape had dissolved and my heart still lay blackened
          <br />
          Losing all hope was not unusual for me
          <br />
          But I swear that concave feeling grew a little more empty
          <br />
          <br />
          One last time I take my heart from where it rests
          <br />
          With no more ideas
          <br />
          I search frantically through my desk
          <br />
          Pencils, paper, nothing that would do
          <br />
          No life left for my heart
          <br />
          I’ve become a walking tomb
          <br />
          <br />
          I curl myself at the foot of my bed
          <br />
          My heart in my hands and grief in my head
          <br />
          Tears falling on my heart and dripping into the cracks
          <br />
          I don’t notice as my heart starts to knit itself back
          <br />
          <br />
          Back to the way it used to be
          <br />
          Shiny and lovely with a glossy pink sheen
          <br />
          It cuts through the darkness and the light only rises
          <br />
          Showing me that life is still full of surprises
          <br />
          Still full of love and still full of hope
          <br />
          Life is still with me, hasn’t left me alone
          <br />
          <br />
          My heart is now beating
          <br />
          On my palm in which it lays
          <br />
          So I swallow the light back down
          <br />
          And from within me, I blaze
