          I am Titanic
          <br />
          I’ve given birth to the gods
          <br />
          I let all of my fears
          <br />
          Fade with every pause
          <br />
          The Earth has on its axis
          <br />
          For it hesitates when it feels
          <br />
          My fingers brush against it
          <br />
          Like my own spinning wheel
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          I’d get drunk off of power
          <br />
          But there’s no more to taste
          <br />
          No more to devour
          <br />
          I hold it all in my herculean grip
          <br />
          The key to every prize that I’m destined to win
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          Which means I will fall
          <br />
          From the dais on which I stand
          <br />
          To the ground on which I’ll crawl
          <br />
          Others will take over
          <br />
          Reveal I was never in control
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          A wretched, evil soul
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          A ship of great renowned
          <br />
          Never set sail
          <br />
          But still rumors abound
          <br />
          “The greatest”, “The biggest”
          <br />
          Ostentatious like a king
          <br />
          I expect people to bow
          <br />
          I expect people to sing
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          Careless in my moves
          <br />
          How am I to hurt others
          <br />
          When I’ve been told what is true
          <br />
          I am invincible
          <br />
          Impossible to harm
          <br />
          I can’t sink beneath waves
          <br />
          No need to sound alarms
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          So of course I will crash
          <br />
          The smallest of splitters
          <br />
          Turned into a fatal, bloody gash
          <br />
          I’m underwater
          <br />
          As it was fated to be
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          Forever lost at sea
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          Which means I never learn
          <br />
          That I don’t float on water
          <br />
          Don’t make the world turn
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          Which means I keep losing
          <br />
          Keep falling from the heavens
          <br />
          Keep drowning and choosing
          <br />
          The same mistakes I’ve made before
          <br />
          Building my castle of gold
          <br />
          The one that crumbles at my feet
          <br />
          That never grows old
          <br />
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          Lusting for glory and revenge
          <br />
          I am Titanic
          <br />
          Bound to fail again
