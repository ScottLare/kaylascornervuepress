          Her cheeks are still round
          <br />
          Still rosy and flushed
          <br />
          Still has wobbly knees
          <br />
          Teeth that don’t touch
          <br />
          Born not even two decades ago
          <br />
          But young girls are liked best when they’re ready to grow
          <br />
          <br />
          Cherry red lips are what the magazines suggest
          <br />
          Low plunging necklines to tease a bit of chest
          <br />
          Eighteens the age when it’s all well and fine
          <br />
          But it’s important to practice before the starting line
          <br />
          <br />
          Perfect does exist
          <br />
          Though the qualifications blurry
          <br />
          She knows she doesn’t meet them
          <br />
          So she spends her time worried
          <br />
          About a round stomach
          <br />
          Thighs that stick together
          <br />
          She spends her days trying
          <br />
          To match the weight of a feather
          <br />
          <br />
          Owning her sexuality is what they tell her to say
          <br />
          Skimpy shorts and tube tops are the feminist way
          <br />
          The adults on tv pretending sixteen’s their age
          <br />
          Because young women don’t get the chance to be children these days
          <br />
          <br />
          Closing the door on childhood too soon
          <br />
          She’s given the lock and told to let loose
          <br />
          No longer is vanity viewed as a sin
          <br />
          Mirrors becoming a necessity to live
          <br />
          <br />
          Girl after girl growing into the mold
          <br />
          Told you can only be young or only be old
          <br />
          There is no balance, no slow dip into maturity
          <br />
          Just innocent eyes bathed in impurity
          <br />
          <br />
          Culture caving in as expectations only rise
          <br />
          There is no top of the mountain, no gold plated prize
          <br />
          She stares at the ground where her youth has been buried
          <br />
          She’s been old for so long and she’s yet to reach thirty
